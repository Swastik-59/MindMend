## ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance & Limitations

- The app may be **slow to respond initially** due to Render‚Äôs cold start behavior for free-tier deployments.
- ElevenLabs API has a **limited token quota**, and when exhausted, the app automatically switches to browser-based speech synthesis.
- In case of token exhaustion, audio playback might fall back to a lower-quality voice, depending on the browser.
